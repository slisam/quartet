<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<b>Quartet</b> is played with a deck of 20 cards (or any number of cards that is a multiple of 4 and
the number of players). The deck can be partitioned into 5 groups of 4 matching cards each
– each of those groups is called a quartet. In the physical games, cards of a quartet often
share some symbol or color or they belong together in another way, for example four soccer
players of a national team, or four instruments of a family.<br /><br />

  
<b> Start of the game:</b><br />
  ​ Cards are split evenly between players. Keep the cards in your hand and
do not show them to the other players. Put the deck of remaining cards closed on the table.
It rarely happens, but if you receive 4 cards of the same set, you have a complete quartet,
which you can put open on the table.<br /><br />
<b>Course of the game: </b><br />
  ​Decide who starts the game. When it is your turn, ask one of the other
players a card you do not possess. This must be a card of a quartet (set) of which you own
at least 1 card. Say the name of the quartet [for example ‘strings ‘] and ask for the card [for
example, ‘cello ‘] from the quartet you want to have. If that player has the ‘cello’, then he
must hand this card over to you. You may continue asking cards, also from another player. If
the player does not have the requested card, your turn is finished and you can take a cardfrom the deck. The last player from whom you asked a card, takes the next turn. If you have
a complete set of 4 cards, you say out loud: ‘Quartet!’ and put the quartet open on the table.<br /><br />
<b>End of the game:</b><br />
  ​ When all players have played all their cards, the game is over. The player
with the most quartets is the winner.
